                <p class="text-left">I approached this project with a sense of unease about what lies ahead. The pressing issues of climate change, pandemics, and political instability create an air of uncertainty that hangs over our world. It seems as though we are living in a time that is both literally and metaphorically akin to the days before the death of the sun.</p>

                <p class = "text-right">This project represents a collection of our efforts to address the daunting question of how humanity can endure the inevitable demise of the sun. The sheer magnitude of this issue leaves room for countless possibilities, and while the answer may ultimately elude us, our pursuit to uncover it must never cease.</p>

            <p>I approached this project as phase 1 of this exploration. Looking specifically into the potential of textiles and surfaces that can generate clean oxygen and renewable energy for humanity to live off of in the case of the death of the sun. Offering a new approach to combating climate change.</p>
